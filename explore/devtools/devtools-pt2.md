1. The bug was when the calculateSum function added num1 and num2, since the input from the user is a string for num1 and num2, addition operators default is concatenation of strings rather than addition of numbers, so when the user typed say 1 and then 2, those are interpreted as strings and will be concatenated to 12 instead of added to 3.
2. You fix this by calling the Number() function on both num1 and num2 and store those values inside of result, that way the addition operator will perform addition with, for example, the user types string "1", so it will be converted to a number 1, and string "2" converted to a number 2, effectively adding 1 and 2 to result in 3.
